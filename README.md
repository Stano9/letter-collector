# Solution
✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

Solution is in src/classes/LetterCollector.class.ts
Tests are in e2e/src/classes.letterCollector.spect.ts

## Start the app
1. npm install
2. To start the development server run `npx nx serve solution`.
3. To run the tests run `npx nx run e2e:e2e`.

I did not understand this part of the challenge because in the notes 
it says turns can be letters or + so i don't see the logic to this sequence

Fake turn
@-A-+-B-x
Expected result: Error
